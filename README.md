# Time Feel

![Screen shot of Time Feel](screenshot.png)

Inspired by Scott Thrift's now discontinued [Today Clock](https://timeincolor.com/products/today), *Time Feel* is a simple clock that gives you a sense of what time it is. The bottom of the clock marks midnight, and the top marks noon. A gradient conveys the shift from night to day. *Time Feel* allows you to know roughly what time it is — without knowing *exactly* what time it is — and visualize how much of today there is left.
